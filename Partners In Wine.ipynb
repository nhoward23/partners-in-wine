    "### What is the dataset?\n",
    "This dataset is various attributes describing the makeup of the wine Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. The classification is a rating from 1-10 to decribe the quality of the wine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will we do with this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: We analyzed the dataset with K-means clustering in order to discover what attributes are essential to having a quality wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: We used KNN, Naive Bayes, K-means clustering, and KNN-Bagging Ensemble classifiers on our dataset. We use these to predict the quality of a wine based on various attributes of our choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What classification performed the best?\n",
    "Naive Bayes and K-means clustering were both are best classifiers with an accuracy around 80%. We hypothesize that these perform the best because the classification are distributed in a way that 5 and 6 are our most common label.\n"

    "Data Analysis: This section must provide details about the dataset. You must include:\n",
    "Information about the dataset itself, e.g., the attributes and attribute types, the number of instances, and the attribute being used as the label.\n",
    "Relevant summary statistics about the dataset.\n",
    "Data visualizations highlighting important/interesting aspects of your dataset. Visualizations may include frequency distributions, comparisons of attributes (scatterplot, multiple frequency diagrams), box and whisker plots, etc. The goal is not to include all possible diagrams, but instead to select and highlight diagrams that provide insight about the dataset itself.\n",
    "Note that this section must describe the above (in paragraph form) and not just provide diagrams and statistics. Also, each figure included must have a figure caption (Figure number and textual description) that is referenced from the text (e.g., “Figure 2 shows a frequency diagram for ...”).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has approximately 1600 instances. There are 12 attributes and they are all continuous. They are floats. The attribute being used as the label is the quality attribute. It is ranked on a scale from 1-10. [View the dataset here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). \n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes are:\n",
    "- fixed acidity\n",
    "- volatile acidity\n",
    "- citric acid\n",
    "- residual sugar\n",
    "- chlorides \n",
    "- free sulfur dioxide \n",
    "- total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "- density \n",
    "- pH\n",
    "- sulfates\n",
    "- alcohol\n",
    "- **quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Statistics and Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we aren't oenologists , we don't really know much about these attributes and their relations. Since we really only care about how it relates to the quality, we will perform K-means clustering to analyze the data. We will cluster them and see what the majority classification is for that cluster. Then, we will get the average of each attribute and see if we can spot any differences between these clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we do that, it is important to view the distribution of our classifications. This will give us an insight in our future classification predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### No. of quality ratings:\n",
    "As you can see in Figure 1, the majority of the dataset is classified as either a 5 or 6. There are some 3's, 7's, and 8's but no 9 or 10. This distribution is important to be aware of when we start our classifications."

    "With this classification approach, we first split our dataset into 1/3 testing and 2/3 remainder. Then, the remainder set is split into 2/3 training and 1/3 validation. For each of the k canditate classifiers, we train the classifier on our training set, and then determine it's accuracy over the validation set. We only use this classifier if it's accuracy is over a certain threshold. If it qualifies, it get's added to the ensemble.\n",

The bagging method involves taking our remaining data (size N), and randomly selecting N instances from this data (with replacement) to form our training set. Many instances will be selected more than once, and some not at all. Whatever isn't selected is put into the validation set. "
